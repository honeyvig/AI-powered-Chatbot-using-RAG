# AI-powered-Chatbot-using-RAG
We are seeking a skilled developer to build an AI-driven chatbot for our website. The chatbot should leverage advanced AI models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to assist users with both public and private data sets. The ideal candidate will have experience in developing chatbots and integrating AI functionalities, providing a seamless user experience.
================
To build an AI-driven chatbot leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques, you will need to combine Natural Language Processing (NLP) with a retrieval system to gather relevant information from both public and private datasets. RAG combines retrieval (fetching documents) with generation (producing a response), and it's useful for situations where your chatbot needs to answer questions based on large knowledge bases or specific user queries.

Here’s a step-by-step guide with Python code to implement this:
Step 1: Set up the Environment

Install the necessary libraries:

pip install openai transformers langchain faiss-cpu

Step 2: Set Up the Retrieval System

You’ll use FAISS for efficient vector search to retrieve relevant documents, and LangChain for integrating LLMs and retrieval systems.

import faiss
import numpy as np
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
from langchain.embeddings import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.chains import LLMChain
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool, AgentType

# Load a pre-trained tokenizer and model for embeddings
model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Create a function to encode text into vectors
def encode(texts):
    inputs = tokenizer(texts, padding=True, truncation=True, return_tensors="pt")
    with torch.no_grad():
        embeddings = model(**inputs).last_hidden_state.mean(dim=1)
    return embeddings.numpy()

# Initialize the FAISS index
index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(768)  # FAISS index for 768-d embeddings

# Function to add documents to FAISS index
def add_documents_to_index(documents):
    vectors = encode(documents)
    faiss.normalize_L2(vectors)
    index.add(vectors)

# Sample documents for index
documents = ["Your public knowledge base here.", "Private data can be added here."]
add_documents_to_index(documents)

Step 3: Set Up the Generative Model

Use OpenAI's GPT model (or another LLM) to generate text and create the RAG model.

import openai

# Set up OpenAI API
openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"

# Function to generate responses from GPT model
def generate_response(prompt):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

Step 4: Integrate the Retrieval with Generation (RAG)

This is where the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technique comes into play. First, retrieve the relevant documents using FAISS, then augment the retrieved information with GPT to form a complete response.

# Function to retrieve top documents based on a user query
def retrieve_documents(query, top_k=3):
    query_vector = encode([query])
    faiss.normalize_L2(query_vector)
    D, I = index.search(query_vector, top_k)  # D = distances, I = indices
    retrieved_documents = [documents[i] for i in I[0]]
    return retrieved_documents

# Function to generate the final answer using RAG (retrieve + generate)
def rag_response(query):
    retrieved_docs = retrieve_documents(query)
    
    # Combine retrieved docs into a prompt for GPT
    context = "\n".join(retrieved_docs)
    prompt = f"Given the following context, answer the user's query:\n\n{context}\n\nUser Query: {query}"
    
    return generate_response(prompt)

Step 5: Building the Chatbot Interface

You can now integrate the above functions into your chatbot interface. Here's a basic example using Flask for creating a web-based chatbot.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify

app = Flask(__name__)

# Endpoint to handle user queries
@app.route('/ask', methods=['POST'])
def ask():
    user_query = request.json.get("query")
    if not user_query:
        return jsonify({"error": "Query is required"}), 400
    
    answer = rag_response(user_query)
    return jsonify({"response": answer})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Step 6: Deploy the Chatbot

After setting up the AI chatbot, you can deploy the Flask app to a cloud service like AWS, Heroku, or DigitalOcean for easy access.
Step 7: Adding Private Data Integration

For private data, ensure you:

    Store sensitive information securely (e.g., using encrypted databases).
    Provide access control, such as API keys, for querying the private data.
    Implement user authentication and authorization.

Example Workflow for Handling Private and Public Data

    User submits a query.
    Retrieve data from both public and private data sources based on the query using the FAISS index and custom APIs for private data.
    Generate an answer by combining retrieved data and processing it using the generative model.
    Return the response back to the user.

Example Chatbot Conversation

User: What are the latest fashion trends for 2024?

Bot: Based on the public and private fashion data, the latest trends for 2024 include oversized denim jackets, bright neon colors, and eco-friendly materials. Would you like more details on any specific trend?

Step 8: Testing and Optimization

Test your chatbot extensively, ensuring it handles various queries accurately:

    Public Data: Make sure the chatbot pulls data effectively from public knowledge bases.
    Private Data: Ensure secure access to private datasets and proper data handling.
    Response Quality: Evaluate the quality of responses generated by the AI model and fine-tune the prompt engineering.

Conclusion

This is a basic setup for building an AI-powered chatbot using RAG. It leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enhance user experience by retrieving and generating answers from both public and private datasets. By using libraries like FAISS for efficient data retrieval and OpenAI GPT for generating high-quality responses, you can create a powerful and intelligent chatbot.
